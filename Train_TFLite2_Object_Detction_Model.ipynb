        "\n",
        "This notebook uses [the TensorFlow 2 Object Detection API](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection) to train an SSD-MobileNet model or EfficientDet model with a custom dataset and convert it to TensorFlow Lite format. By working through this Colab, you'll be able to create and download a TFLite model that you can run on your PC, an Android phone, or an edge device like the Raspberry Pi.\n",

        "Colab provides a virtual machine in your browser complete with a Linux OS, filesystem, Python environment, and best of all, a free GPU. It comes with most TensorFlow backend requirements (like CUDA and cuDNN) pre-installed. Simply click the play button on sections of code in this notebook to execute them on the virtual machine.\n",
        "\n",
        "> *Note: Make sure you're using a GPU-equipped machine by going to \"Runtime\" -> \"Change runtime type\" in the top menu bar, and then selecting \"GPU\" from the Hardware accelerator dropdown.*\n",
        "\n",
        "This Colab notebook uses TensorFlow 2. If you'd like to use TensorFlow 1, please see my [TF1 Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/EdjeElectronics/TensorFlow-Lite-Object-Detection-on-Android-and-Raspberry-Pi/blob/master/Train_TFLite1_Object_Detection_Model.ipynb).\n",
